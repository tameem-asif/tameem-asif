### Hi there 👋
My name is Tameem and I am student studying Computer Engineering at Columbia University 🦁. 

I am actively involved in:
- 🏎 CU Formula Racing
- 🦾 Columbia Uniersity Robotics Club 
- 🏛 Engineering Student Council

Those are all things I love talking about (and often don't stop talking about)!

🔭 I’m currently working on a custom static site generator that I plan to use for my personal website.
